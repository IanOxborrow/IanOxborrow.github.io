    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12 content"><p>I undertook my role at BuildItPayIt as part of ANU’s TechLauncher program. Under this program, students complete an internship, gaining experience in a professional work environment and with a real project. As a part of the team, I was responsible for building a mobile application that allows builders to collect payment and hold it in esgrow.</p>

<p>My role included developing the app’s front-end using React Native, and integrating RESTful APIs with the backend to retrieve and display data. Part of my responsibility included designing the bulk of the UX/UI of the app. The team and I were also involved with directly engaging stakeholders to ensure their needs and requirements were being met throughout the project. This involved regular communication, presenting progress updates, and gathering feedback to make necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>Throughout my time at BiPi, I learned a lot about React Native, especially its capabilities for cross-platform mobile application development. I also gained experience in Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban, which helped our team work together more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>Overall, my experience as a React Native developer at BiPi was extremely fulfilling, and I am proud of the work that the team and I accomplished. The skills and knowledge that I gained during my time there have been invaluable, and I look forward to using them in future projects.</p>
